### Initially, after receiving the assignments, I paid close attention to understanding and analyzing the requirements as well as the task scheduling.

## Python Tasks: <br />

 - **Task 1 Description:** Sort a list of names alphabetically without using the built-in function sort().<br />
 **Solution:**<br />
To complete this task, I used the bubble sort algorithm, So I defined sorted_function() that takes a list as an argument and returns a sorted list. The (first for loop )
is to access each array element and the (second for loop) is to compare the elements. Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements. If the first element is greater than the second element they are swapped,
and the process continues until the last element. <br />

- **Task 2 Description:** Using two dates as input, calculate the interval of time between them.<br />
**Solution:**<br />
To complete this task, I defined a function that takes two dates as an argument and returns the date difference between them.
I used the date class from datetime module to determine the date difference. <br />

- **Task 3 Description:** Function to determine whether or not a number has been divided by all of its digits.<br />
**Solution:**<br />
To complete this task, I used list comprehension to make a new list based on the number by splitting that number into digits.
I defined divisibility_check() function that takes the list as an argument and check if whether all digits of n divide it or not .<br />

## JavaScript Task: <br />
- **Task 4 Description:** Using Fixer API create a running currency converter tool, which is a SPA, and style it uses CSS to match the provided design.<br /> 
**Solution:**<br />
To complete this task. I used React JavaScript library which is ideal for developing SPA (Single-Page Application).<br />
I started by making the UI currency component, In order to use it for the fields that contain a currency amount and a list of currencies. In addition I used CSS to style the component to match the specified design.<br />
The useState hook is used to take user input and store it in a state variable, as well as to handle other state changes. The useEffect hook is used to handle the API calls.
We are using fixer API to fetch a list of all available currencies as well as conversion rates.<br />
The states are passed in as props in our UI component . 

## Odoo Task: <br />

- **Task 5 Description:** create a new module palette_tracking for the provided requirement, Please adhere to the PEP8 style guide,Also provide the Arabic translation.<br />
<br />When I initially read about the Odoo task, I took my time to grasp what Odoo is and how it works, what the Architecture it follows, the module structure and so on, Since everything about Odoo was new to me.<br />
Therefore, I decided that before getting started, I should read the documentation and study it until I have a clear mental vision of how to develop my own Odoo module.<br />
Odoo is one of the promising software that I will definitely continue to learn,
#### ***But Unfortunately I was unable to complete this task by the deadline because it took me longer to learn more than I planned.***<br />

### <br />Finally, I cannot express how much I value the knowledge this interview exam has given me.<br />
